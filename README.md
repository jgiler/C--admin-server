## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/)

## How to use?

Clone this repo and then in the C# files I would change the generic connection string I put in the startup file to your DB that you like to connect. Next follows the instructions below starting in the root of the project.

In the terminal run

```bash
cd backend
dotnet run
```

Now open a new terminal and run

```bash
cd frontend
npm run start
```

Then they will be communicating with each other.
