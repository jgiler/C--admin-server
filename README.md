## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/)

## How to use?
Clone this repo and then in the C# files I would change the generic connection string I put in the startup file to your DB that you like to connect then from there run the application. While thats running open a terminal and be inside the frontend dir and run 
```
npm run start
```
Then they will be communicating with each other.
